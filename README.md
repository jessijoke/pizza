# Pizza Savant

Pizza Savant is an original responsive web design coded in html, css, and vanilla javascript, and utilizing the Google maps embed API.

The entire site uses a CSS aniamtion framework to create scroll animations.

The index page utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox to create the overlapping elements.

The Menu is entirely saved in a JSON files (including the images) and is loaded dynamically when you click each category. 

The about page features a front end contact form (I may add a back end to this later but at the moment it is just the front end), and utilizes the Google Maps Embed API.

Social links are featured in the nav bar, which collapses to be mobile friendly, and has an animated transition on and off screen for mobile devices.

There is a back to top button in the bottom right since the nagivation is not sticky (which was an aesthetic choice).
